                        Inspired by
                        chess.com, CheckMatey is a fully-functional online community
                        for chess players with multi-player functionality as well as
                        single-player games against the computer. There's also
                        a community forum where you can share your chess or pirate-related
                        thoughts with other players. You can even use the move-recording feature
                        to share that new opening you just invented.

                        If your
                        opponent's not online when you want to play, just use the "invite a friend"
                        feature to challenge your friend via email. If you're still
                        online when your friend clicks the link, you'll automatically
                        be put in a game together. Of course, if you prefer Tetris to chess,
                        we've also got you covered.
