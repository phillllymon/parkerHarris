                Hi! I'm Parker. I'm a software developer with a background that
                also includes mechanical engineering and teaching high school math and science.
                I thrive on tackling hard problems. If it seems impossible at first, or if
                others have tried and failed, I'm interested.
                <br>
                <br>
                In October I graduated from the super-rigorous coding bootcamp App Academy,
                where I learned Ruby, Rails, SQL, Javascript, and React. I had some mostly self-taught coding
                abilities before that, but during App Academy I solidified my skills and completed
                some awesome projects. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My experience at App Academy was intense, but it left me confident and excited about transitioning my career into
                full-time software development. Feel free to take a look at my projects below and let
                me know what you think!

                        Who hasn't wished for a pirate-themed chess website? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Inspired by
                        chess.com, CheckMatey is a fully-functional online community
                        for chess players with multi-player functionality as well as
                        single-player games against the computer. There's also
                        a community forum where you can share your chess or pirate-related
                        thoughts with other players. You can even use the move-recording feature
                        to share that new opening you just invented.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If your
                        opponent's not online when you want to play, just use the "invite a friend"
                        feature to challenge your friend via email. If you're still
                        online when your friend clicks the link, you'll automatically
                        be put in a game together. Of course, if you prefer Tetris to chess,
                        we've also got you covered.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        CheckMatey has a Ruby on Rails backend and a React & Redux frontend.

                        Wind & Waves is an interactive sailing simulator that allows you to
                        learn the basics of sailing a small boat while also investigating
                        the various forces that make sailing possible.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Under the hood, Wind & Waves features a physics model
                        that combines forces on the sail, hull, and centerboard to calculate
                        accurate, real-time boat motion. It even calculates rolling 
                        motion, incorporating a sailor whose weight moves
                        automatically to balance the boat.

                        All the physics modeling is coded in pure javascript. The display

                        Don't Die Together! is a top-down, multiplayer zombie survival game. You
                        You start off with a pistol and, with zombies closing in from all sides, you
                        must survive as long as possible. You can invite your friends to play in the
                        same game with you, but be careful: the more players there are, the more zombies
                        arrive!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Don't Die Together! uses MongoDB on the back end and React on the front end. Multiplayer
                        functionality is through Socket.IO. The game rendering uses HTML5 canvas.
